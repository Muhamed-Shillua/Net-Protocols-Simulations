# TCP Simulation

This is a basic simulation of the **Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)**. It demonstrates how the connection setup, data transfer, and connection teardown work in TCP.

## How to Run the Simulation

### 1. **TCP Server**
   - Compile the Server:
     ```bash
     g++ TCP/TCP_Server.cpp -o Server
     ```
   - Run the Server:
     ```bash
     ./Server
     ```

### 2. **TCP Client**
   - Compile the Client:
     ```bash
     g++ TCP/TCP_Client.cpp -o Client
     ```
   - Run the Client:
     ```bash
     ./Client
     ```
